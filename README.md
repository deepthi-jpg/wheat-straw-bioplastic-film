Development and characterization of biodegradable bioplastic films from wheat straw

# Development of Bioplastic Film from Wheat Straw
This repository documents a research project focused on the development of
cellulose-based biodegradable bioplastic films from wheat straw as an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic plastic films.

## Objective
To extract cellulose from wheat straw and develop biodegradable bioplastic films using plasticizers and evaluate their physical, mechanical and
biodegradability properties.

## Materials Used
- Wheat straw cellulose
- Sorbitol
- Gelatin
- Distilled water

## Methodology Overview
- Cellulose extraction from wheat straw
- Film-forming solution preparation
- Casting and drying of bioplastic films
- Evaluation of film properties

## Parameters Analyzed
- Thickness
- Tensile strength
- Solubility
- Swelling index
- Biodegradability

## Conclusion
The developed wheat straw bioplastic films showed good mechanical propertiesand biodegradability, indicating potential application in sustainable food
packaging.
